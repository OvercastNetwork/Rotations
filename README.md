## Overcast Network Rotations

This repository contains a listing of files which correspond to all public [Overcast Network](https://oc.tc) rotations.

### Contributing

You can suggest changes to the rotations by opening an [issue](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Rotations/issues) in this repository. Please make sure your request follows these guidelines:

- A request should add or remove a **single map** to/from the rotations. Multiple changes require multiple issues. Changes to server names and other suggestions belong on the [forums](https://oc.tc/forums/4fc1d973b944ec75030002e2), not here.
- Maps to be added must already be in the OCN [map repository](https://maps.oc.tc/). New maps should be posted to the [forums](https://oc.tc/forums/53f7a8d1d7c83698b7b67499), not here.
- Make sure your request doesn't duplicate an [existing request](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Rotations/issues).
- If you want to re-submit a rejected map because it has been significantly improved, re-open the [existing issue](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Rotations/issues), rather than creating a new one.
- The title of your issue should contain the type of change and the map name e.g. "Add WarWars"
- For additions, the issue description should contain a link to the map release thread on the [forums](https://oc.tc/forums/4fc17996c4637515f7000016), if one exists.

While we welcome community input, please understand that final decisions are made by the OCN development team.

### Auto Deploy :zap:

Changes to these files *will* affect the rotations on production servers after a restart of the corresponding server.  As such, all map names must be valid, and the map must be present in the private Overcast Network maps repo. Travis-CI will automatically validate map names.
